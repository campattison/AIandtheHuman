### **AI and the Human: Interdisciplinary Dialogues on Intelligence and Ethics**

What does it mean to be intelligent in an age of artificial minds? How does AI reshape our sense of justice, power, and what it means to be human? This seminar invites you to explore these questions and many more with experts from across the globe in fields like ethics, consciousness, and AI. From hands-on sessions exploring emerging technologies to discussions about human rights and the ethics of AI, we’ll dive into how AI is transforming a wide range of topics in the humanities. Join us as we engage in lively conversations with leaders in philosophy who are challenging the boundaries of AI and humanity.
